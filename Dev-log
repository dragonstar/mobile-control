Implementation log

Using Python with Flask - https://www.fullstackpython.com/flask.html
SQLite as database layer - http://raspberrywebserver.com/sql-databases/accessing-an-sqlite-database-with-python.html
** not sure ** Uinsg Pyplate on Raspberry Pi as the CMS - http://raspberrywebserver.com/pyplate/install-pyplate-on-a-raspberry-pi.html
Manage code using GIT - maybe GITFLOW (We'll see)
HW - Raspbury Pi 4 Model B (with memory upgrade)
Ended up using Python for system functions & Node-Red for all the distributed UI/Control and tracking

-----------------
Installed Rasperin
Works fine - with fully operational desktop env
Setup SSH access on Pi and remote laptop 
ref: [1] - https://towardsdatascience.com/python-webserver-with-flask-and-raspberry-pi-398423cc6
Using the SSH on laptop in root type or on pi
git init
sudo apt-get install python3-flask
 [already installed]
mkdir rpiWebServer
 - for info - a folder /home/pi/Documents/Server is created in this process
cd rpiWebServer
mkdir static
mkdir templates
Undertook instructions in [1] - all worked
 - - To server time / date display with CSS
  - Mapped drives to macbook
  - Installed Geany in macbook (although trouble connecting it to pi)
  - Camera integration - standalone on wifi
 push to github
 pull to dev evn on mac
 setup distriburted push for updates to dev & production
 Apply 4G and GPS interface
  - Raspberry pi 3g/4g &lte base hat installed 
  - https://sixfab.com/product/raspberry-pi-base-hat-3g-4g-lte-minipcie-cards/
  - Install PCLe Module with antennas - LTE +  GPS
  - https://sixfab.com/product/quectel-ec25-mini-pcle-4glte-module/
  - Tested -PASS - standalone internet accss - PASS
  Configure RBP as an internet access point - using raspAP
  - https://raspap.com/
  - https://github.com/billz/raspap-webgui
  - Test - PASS - using RBP as internet access point for other systems - phone, pc etc.. PASS
 INSTALL BLINK survellance camera on the RBP network 
  - followed instructions
  - PASS - Performance test to 15m PASS
 Installed openCPN
  - Dont forget to use :80 on key port
 Tested GPS
  - inside so no signal
  - run python Programming/GPStest.py (not on python 3)
  Turn on GPS data on USB1
   - use minicom 
   minicom -s
   setup serial port - USB2
   Hardware flow control - No
   Exit
   AT -> ok
   AT+QGPS=1   -> will turn on NMEA gps ON USB1
   AT+QGPSEND  -> WILL turn off

   Order 12V psu - https://sixfab.com/product/raspberry-pi-power-management-ups-hat/   
 22 may
 - PSU arrived
  - PIR integrated and tested through code and led PASSED
  - mag sensor tested PASSED
Integrated and tested with Twitter 
POWER HAT
Integrate & test 12V psu - https://sixfab.com/product/raspberry-pi-power-management-ups-hat/
https://docs.sixfab.com/docs/raspberry-pi-power-management-ups-hat-technical-details
GPIO 2 & 2 ARE TAKEN BY THE POPWER HAT - SO do not use these
5V & GND are re-inforced by the hat.
Manage the hat via power.sixfab.com

 - To do --------
-----------------
 might have to move to 
 https://www.aa.net.uk/voice-and-mobile/data-sims/
 as data providor - allows for static ip and ports.
 Look at VPNs
 Might need to setup server.... :|
  - no - way too expensive 
 
 
 Config parser - start integrating this early doors
 UI - https://github.com/creativetimofficial/light-bootstrap-dashboard
 Integrate & test 12V psu - https://sixfab.com/product/raspberry-pi-power-management-ups-hat/
 Develop control interface
  - arm alarm
 Tracker - use sockets & nmea parser
 send forcast by twitter - based on GPS location
 sent inshore forcast - based n GPS location
 Expose IP
 spec breadboard for GPIO testing
 Test control interface
 Robin to test interface
 12v RELAYs for high power alarm - use
   https://thepihut.com/products/8-relay-card-for-raspberry-pi
